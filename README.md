<i>Xylo</i> can be fully controlled with just the mouse, but there are a few useful hotkeys:

* ESC: Pause
* Space: Replay the level's melody
* P: Open the piano
* R (Hold): Restart the level
  
There are also a few debug keys for testing:

* Shift + D + 1: Deletes all save data
* Shift + D + 2: Triggers a win for the current level
