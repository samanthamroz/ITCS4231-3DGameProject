Interactable object - abstract class
- children must define an OnClick() becuase MouseManager just checks for types of InteractableObjects
  and does the OnClick()
- change MouseManager to call OnClickAway() on the last object clicked as well
- and OnRelease()

Draggable block
- OnClick() - spawns all handles
- OnClickAway() - despawns all handles

Handles
- OnClick() 
	- start dragging coroutine
	- despawn other sets of handles
- OnRelease()
	- isDragging = false (stops dragging coroutine)
	- respawn other sets of handles
